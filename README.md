## Notes on CSS

The css is divided into a few files:

- `reset.css`
  This is a standard css reset. It s loaded first.
- `grid.css`
  Here is a simple set of utility classes for laying out classes in a 12 section grid
- `helpers.css`
  Here are a set of classes that are useful for applying common styles.
- `styles.css`
  This is the custom css **just for this site**.

The reset, grid and helpers can be re-used on other projects.
